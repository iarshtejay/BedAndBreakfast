# About

The main goal of this project is to create a bed and breakfast system in which data will be processed utilizing serverless technologies. The software offers customization options and adds features to authorized users, as well as limited services to visitors. The Serverless B&B offers online virtual support via a chatbot that can instantly respond to users' questions, as well as message forwarding functionality between approved systems. 

B&B is a cloud-based hotel reservation system that allows consumers to register and reserve available rooms as well as select amenities such as ordering meals. B&B is made up of several components that provide a variety of services. The application's Hotel Management component allows users to register and create invoices based on their stay, meals ordered, and additional services availed. A virtual assistant helps with basic website navigation and room availability checks for guests, as well as processing bookings and ordering food for authorized hotel customers. There is an additional feature called tour operator, which will only be engaged if a tour is requested.  

# Technologies Used
